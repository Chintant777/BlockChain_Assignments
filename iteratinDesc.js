/**
 * trick1: 
 *  trick 1 can be used with initial value and with condition. 
 *  on succesful condition we run loop else we break it loop.
 */

/**
 * trick2:
 * ECMA introduced map, filter, reduce methods
 * map iterates and used when want to do common operation to all elements
 * filter iterates and used when want to get elements based on some conditions
 * reduce used to iterate and generate one signle output after process.
 */

/**
 * trick3:
 * Iterators used to iterate one by one it returns object containing next as key
 * and function as value. Function itself uses iterator protocol and have properties
 * value, done and for last property or for some condition done true.
